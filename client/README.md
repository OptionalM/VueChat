# Client

This is the client component.
It's an empty [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) app.

## Project setup
```bash
yarn install
```
installs all the needed dependencies.

Then you can run a server with hot-reload by using
```bash
vue serve
```

You can build the project (such that it can be served by the server) using this command:
```bash
yarn run build
```
